**Subject**: Progress Update and Clarifications on Clickstream Data and Use Case

Hi Dinesh,

I wanted to share some updates and ask for clarification on the goals we are aiming for with the real-time pipeline, particularly around the clickstream data.

### What We Have:
1. The pipeline is set up to read from Hive, simulate a real-time stream, and write the processed data into HBase.
2. The source is a **clickstream table** that updates every 6 hours, which I’ve been using while we wait for the main data point source.
3. I’ve connected with Saugat to discuss the transformation logic, but I’m still unclear on the specifics of the use case and what is expected in terms of processing scale and logic.

### Questions and Next Steps:
1. **Success Criteria**: 
   - I’m trying to understand the success criteria for this pipeline using the clickstream data. Since the original project was intended to build on the data point source, it’s unclear what we want to achieve with this interim clickstream data.
   
2. **Pipeline Use Case**: 
   - While I’ve made progress on the pipeline setup, I’m unsure of the **specific use case** we should be targeting. Should I be focusing on any particular transformation logic or processing size, or are we still working on defining that?
   - My assumption was that I’d get more clarity once I understood the source data better, but after my discussions with Saugat, I’m still not entirely clear on how this data fits into the broader pipeline goals.

### Next Steps:
- I’d appreciate your guidance on defining the use case and any specific outcomes we should be demonstrating with this clickstream data while we wait for the main source.
