I’ve done some initial testing of GitHub Copilot, focusing on SQL and PySpark use cases. It’s quite effective at suggesting common functions and autofill options, but it struggles with more complex tasks like generating insights or handling enterprise-level queries, where detailed schema knowledge (e.g., Hive tables or Spark definitions) is necessary.

That said, it could still be valuable as a support tool for simpler tasks. I’m open to further exploring its capabilities and experimenting with more specific use cases to better assess its full potential. If you’d like, we can discuss what use cases might be worth a deeper dive or connect on a call to go over this in more detail.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.
