**Subject**: Clarifying Expectations and Next Steps for the Real-Time Pipeline

Hi Dinesh,

I wanted to provide updates on the progress so far and ask for some clarification on the expectations for the real-time pipeline. There are a few points where I’m looking to better understand the interpretation of the pipeline and what’s being asked from my end. I’ve also included some suggestions for how we might want to think about the design and its use cases.

### What We Have:
1. We’ve set up a pipeline that reads from Hive, processes data to simulate a real-time stream, and writes the processed data into HBase.
2. The source is a **clickstream table** that updates every 6 hours, which doesn’t fully align with typical real-time scenarios.
3. I’ve connected with Saugat to discuss transformation logic and the source. We’re exploring how this can be shaped into a useful real-time use case.

### Questions and Thoughts:
1. **Real-Time Processing vs Expected Pipeline Behavior**: 
   - Based on the current source (clickstream updated every 6 hours), I’m trying to understand how the **"real-time"** aspect is being interpreted. If we’re receiving data at this interval, would it make sense to build a more **batch-oriented process** instead, or is the idea to anticipate more **frequent updates or live streams** in the future?
   - Is the **end goal** to have real-time decisions and actions triggered for marketing teams or other stakeholders, or is this primarily about setting up the framework for more frequent data in the future?

   *Suggested Consideration*: 
   - If real-time processing is the ultimate goal, we might need to consider if HBase’s **latency** could become an issue and whether other technologies like **in-memory stores** (Redis, Kafka Streams) or **faster NoSQL databases** could be more suitable for true real-time use cases.

2. **Pipeline Design and Source Clarification**: 
   - I recall that we were originally waiting on a specific source before proceeding, and in the meantime, I’ve been directed to focus on building the pipeline with the clickstream data. I’m a bit unclear about what’s expected here—should I focus purely on getting the pipeline functional with this **interim data** source, or are there **specific business outcomes** that need to be demonstrated using this clickstream table?
   - Could we revisit the **initial source** and pipeline expectations? Are there other sources we should expect soon that could shift the design priorities?

   *Suggested Consideration*:
   - While this pipeline is being built around a clickstream source for now, we might consider how flexible the architecture needs to be for **new data sources** in the future. Should we focus on making the framework more **extendable** or modular so that it can quickly adapt when the expected source data becomes available?

3. **Solution Design and Workaround Suggestions**:
   - As we’re currently working with a source that has a 6-hour update cycle, there’s a question of whether we should focus on **simulating real-time conditions** with the existing data or build a **modular framework** that can accommodate **future real-time streams** more seamlessly.
   - One approach could be to implement a **hybrid model** where we start with **mini-batches** of data to simulate more frequent updates, while ensuring the system can scale to true real-time as more live sources come in.

   *Suggested Consideration*: 
   - Should we define **clear KPIs or success criteria** for the pipeline now, based on this interim clickstream source, so we can iterate once the full data source becomes available? This would help in ensuring the pipeline can scale effectively while addressing real-time use cases more thoroughly in the future.

I would appreciate your guidance on the above points so that we can move forward with more clarity on the design and ensure we are aligned with the business expectations.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

### Nuance Breakdown:

- **Question 1** focuses on exploring what "real-time" means for this use case given the current source limitations. You’re tactfully questioning whether batch processing makes more sense or if there’s a longer-term goal for real-time.
- **Question 2** highlights your current confusion about the pipeline’s purpose while offering a way to reframe it around the original source or possible future sources.
- **Solution suggestions** point to actionable considerations like modularity, hybrid models, and defining KPIs—these are key for building towards real-time while acknowledging the current limitations.

Does this revision capture the nuance you were aiming for? Would you like to adjust any part before sending it to your manager?
